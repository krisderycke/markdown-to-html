        <h2 id="choosingone">Choosing one:</h2>
        
        <pre><code> After looking into different IDE's, the IDE of my choice will be Visual Studio Code because on Google Trends it seems like the most popular and worldwide used program.
        </code></pre>
        
        <h2 id="what">What?</h2>
        
        <p>Visual Studio Code can be used to write codes in different languages, such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Ruby, etc. 
          Here is an example of a Ruby code:</p>
        
        <p><code>ruby
        require 'redcarpet'
        markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
        puts markdown.to_html
        </code></p>

          <li>This is particularly handy when you have issues and are looking for solutions.  </li>
          
          <li>It also seems like a good program to use for front-end dev's.</li>
          
          <li>Has a built-in GIT control. <br />

          <li>Further more, i have no idea which one is better than the other. <br />

        <p>|  Positives:|   Negatives:  |
        |:----------------|------------------:|
        |1. widely used, so alot of experienced users | * slow launch time, compared to some other IDE's|
        |2. made for <em>Windows, Mac and Linux</em> |* seems to be nothing more than an Atom clone |
        |3. it has useful hints and auto-completion | * uses alot of memory (allegedly :information<em>desk</em>person:) |  </p>
        
        <p>## Conclussion:  </p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><p>[x] <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Download IDE</a>  </p></li>
        
        <li><p>[ ] watch GoT</p></li>
        
        <li><p>[x] look for pro's and cons     </p></li>
        
        <li><p>[ ] play ping-pong </p>
        
        <p>I will use this IDE due to the fact that many developers also use this platform and seems to be <code>very trendy</code> compared to others.
